i have a model that classifies spam or not spam comments with 0.97 accuracy
 Introduction
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify YouTube comments into Spam or Not Spam using Logistic Regression.
The dataset was collected from Kaggle and combined with a Teacher Provided Dataset to ensure diversity and reliability.
Project Workflow
- Data Collection – Downloaded YouTube comments dataset from Kaggle and merged with teacher-provided data.
- Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates, empty values, and unnecessary spaces.
- Data Splitting – Divided into 70% training and 30% testing sets.
- Model Training – Applied supervised learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree).
- Model Evaluation – Compared accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Final Model Selection – Logistic Regression was chosen as the final model due to its balanced performance.
Results
- Logistic Regression achieved 95% accuracy on the test set.
- The model successfully distinguishes between spam and non-spam comments.
